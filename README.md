# Space-Kitty

This is a game about a Kitty, which floats in Space in search of fish-crackers, made with [Bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).
The general idea was borrowed from [Learn Bevy Engine 0.10 series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVnntJRoP85JHGX7rGDu6LaF3fmDDbqyd).
